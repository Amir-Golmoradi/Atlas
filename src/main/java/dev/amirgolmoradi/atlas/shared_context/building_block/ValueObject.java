/**
 * <h3>Base class for Value Objects in the domain model.</h3>
 * <p>
 * Value Objects are immutable by design: once they are initialized, their state
 * cannot and should not change. This immutability guarantees consistency and
 * reliability across the system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One of the main benefits of using Value Objects is to prevent confusion or
 * mixing of domain information. For example, in a system managing users,
 * Value Objects can enforce that user-related information (such as UserId,
 * Email, or Address) is clearly separated and cannot be accidentally interchanged.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Real-life scenario:</b> Imagine a system where you manage customer orders.
 * Each user has a unique UserId, an Email, and a shipping Address. Without Value
 * Objects, it would be easy to accidentally assign a shipping Address of one user
 * to another, or use a UserId in place of an Email, causing wrong deliveries or
 * account mix-ups. By encapsulating each concept in its own Value Object, the
 * compiler and design enforce that UserId, Email, and Address are always used
 * correctly, avoiding costly mistakes in production.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Value Objects also define equality based on their content rather than identity,
 * making comparisons and collections behavior (like HashSet or HashMap) predictable
 * and safe.
 * </p>
